# Employee-Attrition-Control-Determinant
What is employee attrition?
It is the reduction in staff or employee over a period of time due to voluntarily or by being laid-off by the company.
Employee attrition rate is usually calculated as total number of employees lost by the total number of employees previously x 100.

The objective of this project is to determine:
- What type of employees are leaving? 
- Which employees are prone to leave next? 
- By understanding what  type of employees are prone to leave the company, we can predict the future employee who would tend to leave the company.
